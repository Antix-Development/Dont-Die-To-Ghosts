Don't Die To Ghosts is my second submission for the 2022 [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com) competition, where over a one month period you create a game based on a theme (death for 2022) and then you cram your entire game (code and assets) into a 13Kb zip file and submit it.

You can play Don't Die To Ghosts on [its js13k competition page](https://js13kgames.com/entries/), or download index.html from this repository and open it in your web browser.

## Introduction

Don't Die To Ghosts is a 2 dimensional side view game inspired by the classic arcade game [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man), written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The game loosely fits in with the 2022 js13k theme of death in so much as the player will die if they are munched by a ghost.

## Gameplay

The aim of Don't Die To Ghosts is to complete successive levels (to beat the best score) by munching all the dots (244 of them), munching the bonus fruit (nom nom), and trying not to Die To Ghosts.

There are two power pills per level which can be munched to enable the player to munch ghosts for a short time.

Like Pac-Man, the player can leave either side of the screen and reappear on the opposite side.

The default controls for Don't Die To Ghosts are..
- Z or LEFT ARROW to move left.
- X or RIGHT ARROW to move right.
- On mobile devices tap the LEFT and RIGHT sides of the screen to move left and right.

The controls can be changed in the options menu and persist between game sessions.

Don't Die To Ghosts is best enjoyed in fullscreen mode with some chip music playing in the background. If you don't know what your browsers fullscreen hotkey is, there is a handy button at the top right of the screen to toggle fullscreen mode.
